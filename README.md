Deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays

# COVID X-Ray Detection with CNN

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia or normal. It is based on the Coronalhack dataset from Kaggle.

## Features

- Image preprocessing
- CNN architecture with dropout
- Training history and performance plots
- Experiments with hyperparameters (Dense size, Dropout)

## Dataset

- [Coronahack Chest X-Ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset)

## Results

- Achieved 95â€“96% validation accuracy
- Observed overfitting and adjusted model complexity to improve generalization

## How to Run

Open `covid_xray_classifier.ipynb` in Google Colab and run each cell.
